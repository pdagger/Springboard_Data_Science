# Linear regression model

In this project the dataset from the Boston housing price is used to build several linear regression models predicting a 
house's price. A comparison of the different models is done and a method to remove outliers from a model is shown.

To reproduce this work in Python 3.6 you need:
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Sklearn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
