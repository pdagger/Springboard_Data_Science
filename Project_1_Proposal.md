# Project 1 Proposal: 

## Problem:
When entering the job market for the first time or when transitioning to a new career path it is difficult to asses what the base salary for a given position should be. This problem is enhanced when we move to a new area or a different country given that salaries do not only depend on the field we have been trained but are also affected by the location where we are going to work. In order to help not only applicants but also employers it will be helpful to develop a model predicting the base salary that an employee should expect based on previous data about income.
