# Project 1 Proposal: Predicting salaries

## Problem:
When entering the job market for the first time or when transitioning to a new career path it is difficult to assess what the base salary for a given position should be. This problem is enhanced when we move to a new area or a different country given that salaries do not only depend on the field the candidate has been trained but are also affected by the geographical location. In order to help not only applicants but also employers, it will be helpful to develop a model to predict the base salary a future employee should expect based on the data collected from US work visa applications.

## Possible Clients:
* Professionals looking to migrate to the US or inside the US.
* Recruiters and HR departments.

## Data:
Initially the curated data will be obtained directly from [Kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/nsharan/h-1b-visa). This data contains the position title, company, location and salary pertaining to H-1B visa applications, which is a category for specialty workers. However if time permits, additional data will be obtained directly from the [United States Department of Labor](https://www.foreignlaborcert.doleta.gov/performancedata.cfm) in order to include job positions pertaining to non-specialty workers and other visa categories.

## Approach:
The purpose of the project is to predict an expected salary based on historical data, so this will be a supervised regression problem where the location, job title and company are going to be used as predictors for determaining a salary.

## Deliverables:
* Code for:
  * Data cleaning if performed.
  * Data analysis and regression.
* Written report.
* Presentation.
